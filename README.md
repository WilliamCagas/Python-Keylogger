# Python-Keylogger

Note: This project was only created for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES only. 

A keylogger is a surveillance software that can log every pressed key from a computer. It can be used to gather information. My end goal was to create a functional program using Python could log my own data and send it to my email.


For Use:

Needs a gmail account with 2FA enabled.

1. Go into 2FA settings of the gmail account
2. Look for and create an app password
3. Paste the app password into the string for self.SENDER_PASS variable

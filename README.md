# Python-Keylogger

Note: This project was only created for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES only. 

A keylogger is a surveillance software that can log every pressed key from a computer. It can be used to gather information. My end goal was to create a functional program using Python that allowed to create my own keylogger, and send information to my email.
